# cs375 - Michael Seutin 
Repo to host my computer graphics homeworks for Spring 2023.

## WebGL Website
I chose [Experiments with Google](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/search?q=WebGL) as my goto WebGL website.  
The layout and front page are clean, organized and easy on the eye.  
There are plenty of choices to satisfy my needs.  
I am a big fan of clean, nofrills UIs.
